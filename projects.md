## Projects

I like to program - these days mostly in C, Ruby, and TypeScript. Most everything I do is open-sourced on GitHub. Below are the projects that I'm currently working on/thinking about the most these days.

* [kddnewton/exreg](https://github.com/kddnewton/exreg) - A regular expression engine written in Ruby.
* [kddnewton/yarv](https://github.com/kddnewton/yarv) - A YARV emulator written in Ruby.
* [ruby-syntax-tree/syntax_tree](https://github.com/ruby-syntax-tree/syntax_tree) - An AST builder, formatter, and language server for Ruby.

I also actively maintain a lot of projects I've written in the past that I'm still happy with/are still serving their purpose. Below are a couple that I still look in on regularly.

* [kddnewton/gemfilelint](https://github.com/kddnewton/gemfilelint) - A security linter for Ruby `Gemfile` files.
* [prettier/plugin-ruby](https://github.com/prettier/plugin-ruby) - A prettier plugin for the Ruby language.
* [prettier/plugin-xml](https://github.com/prettier/plugin-xml) - A prettier plugin for the XML specification.
