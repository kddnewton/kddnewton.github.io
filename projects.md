## Projects

I like to program - these days mostly in Ruby, TypeScript, and C. Most everything I do is open-sourced on GitHub. Below are the projects that I'm currently working on/thinking about the most these days.

* [kddnewton/regular_expression](https://github.com/kddnewton/regular_expression) - A regular expression engine written in Ruby that compiles down to X86 assembly.
* [kddnewton/syntax_tree](https://github.com/kddnewton/syntax_tree) - An AST builder, formatter, and language server for Ruby.
* [prettier/plugin-ruby](https://github.com/prettier/plugin-ruby) - A prettier plugin for the Ruby language.
* [prettier/plugin-xml](https://github.com/prettier/plugin-xml) - A prettier plugin for the XML specification.
* [vue-a11y/eslint-plugin-vuejs-accessibility](https://github.com/vue-a11y/eslint-plugin-vuejs-accessibility) - An eslint plugin for checking Vue.js files are accessibility violations.

I also actively maintain a lot of projects I've written in the past that I'm still happy with/are still serving their purpose. Below are a couple that I still look in on regularly.

* [kddnewton/fast_underscore](https://github.com/kddnewton/fast_underscore) - A native and fast `String#underscore` implementation.
* [kddnewton/gemfilelint](https://github.com/kddnewton/gemfilelint) - A security linter for Ruby `Gemfile` files.
* [kddnewton/humidifier](https://github.com/kddnewton/humidifier) - A Ruby project for authoring and deploying AWS CloudFormation stacks.
* [kddnewton/preval](https://github.com/kddnewton/preval) - A Ruby utility that automatically optimizes your Ruby code.
